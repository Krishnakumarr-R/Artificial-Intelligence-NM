## Overview

This project focuses on performing AI-powered spam classifier is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. It can be trained on a dataset of labeled messages to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

## Installation

Explain how to install or set up project.include any installation steps,such as;

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrkrishna46/Artificial-Intelligence-NM.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Artificial-Intelligence-NM
```

- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To classify spam messages using the pre-trained model, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Launch a Python environment
- base python spam.py
- Import the spam classifier and use it to classify messages.

## Dependencies

List the dependencies project relies on, including version numbers. For example

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided Jupyter notebooks)
- scikit-learn 0.24.2
- pandas 1.2.4

Include instructions on how to install these dependencies,such as the use of a requirements.txt file

## Dataset

The project uses the [SMS spam classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) dataset from Kaggle, The dataset is a valuable resource for sms spam and hum classifier.

## Result

The "Building a Smarter AI-Powered Spam Classifier" project addresses the problem of spam messages in digital communication. Using a structured approach, we collect and preprocess data, choose the right machine learning algorithms, and apply innovative techniques to create an effective spam classifier. Our goal is to enhance digital communication by filtering out spam messages and ensuring user safety and efficiency.
